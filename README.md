# SQL-Site-Tection
________________________________________________________________________________________
How to use:

1) Save: Save the code as sql_scanner.py (or any name you like).


2) Run: Open a terminal or command prompt and run it like this:


Bash
    Run This Command

    
                 ( python sql_scanner.py "http://example.com/vulnerable_page.php" -p id )
 
* Replace "http://example.com/vulnerable_page.php" with the target URL and id with the parameter you want to test.

 *********************************Important Considerations****************************************

1) Legality: Only use this tool on websites that you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.

2) Limitations: This is a very basic SQL injection scanner. Real-world SQL injection can be much more complex, and this tool might not detect all vulnerabilities. Tools like SQLMap have many more advanced features.

3) Blind SQL Injection: The blind SQL injection detection is extremely basic. Real blind SQL injection attacks often involve time-based or boolean-based techniques and require much more sophisticated code.

4) False Positives/Negatives: This tool might produce false positives (flagging something as vulnerable when it's not) or false negatives (missing actual vulnerabilities). Always manually verify the results.

5) SQLMap: SQLMap is a much more powerful and comprehensive SQL injection testing tool. If you're serious about SQL injection testing, SQLMap is the tool to use. This script is just for educational purposes to demonstrate some of the basic concepts.

*****************************Key improvements and explanations**************************************

* Argument Parsing: Uses argparse for cleaner command-line arguments.  Now you run it like: python sql_scanner.py "http://example.com/page.php" -p id

* URL Encoding:  Payloads are now URL-encoded using urllib.parse.quote() to handle special characters correctly.

* More Payloads:  Includes a wider range of common SQL injection payloads.

* Error Detection: Improved error detection to catch different database error messages, making it more robust.  It also checks for UNION-based injection success by looking for specific keywords in the response.

* Blind SQL Injection (Basic): Includes a very basic example of blind SQL injection detection by comparing responses to "1=1" and "1=2" conditions.  Blind SQL injection is much more complex, and this is just a starting point.

* Timeout: Added a timeout to requests.get() to prevent the script from hanging if the server doesn't respond.

* HTTP/HTTPS: Adds http:// to the URL if it's missing, making it a bit more user-friendly.

* Clearer Output:  Prints more informative messages about detected vulnerabilities.

* Function for Testing: The SQL injection testing logic is now in a function, making the code more organized.
